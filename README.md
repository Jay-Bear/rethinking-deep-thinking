# THIS REPOSITORY IS CURRENTLY BEING UPDATED AND WILL SOON CONTAIN THE PROJECT CODE

## About

This is a repository containing the experiment code for *Rethinking Deep
Thinking: Stable Learning of Algorithms using Lipschitz Constraints*.

The method of running experiments may seem unorthodox. This is due to Bear
writing the vast majority of the code despite not being a Python programmer.
Since the writing of this code, Bear is now much more familiar with Python
programming practices, however this code remains mostly unchanged from the
version used for the initial submission of the paper.

## Running Experiments

### Training Models

Training models involves describing the model and its training routine in
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files. Some JSON config files are provided
in the `configs` directory.

Inside of the `configs` directory is another `README.md` explaining each
part of the training config file, including acceptable values for each
item.
